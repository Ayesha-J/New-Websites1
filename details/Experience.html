        </div>
        <div class="exp12" id="exp12">
            <p>My academic journey as an educator began at the University of Karachi, where I had the opportunity to teach first-year BSc. (Hons.) Physics students. This role was pivotal in shaping my confidence and command over subject matter at the undergraduate level. I designed and delivered lectures on core topics such as mechanics and thermodynamics while conducting lab sessions that emphasized precision and critical thinking. Engaging with highly motivated university students allowed me to refine my presentation skills and adapt complex topics for varied academic backgrounds. This experience significantly boosted my ability to conduct detailed content analysis and strengthened my academic communication.</p>

        <div class="exp12" id="exp12">
            <p>At Habib Girls College, I served as a Physics lecturer for Intermediate-level students, a role that strengthened my ability to manage larger classrooms and maintain student focus through interactive teaching. Here, I adopted innovative methods such as demonstration-based teaching and visual aids, making abstract concepts more relatable. The experience enhanced my classroom management, time management, and student mentoring skills. I also took pride in preparing students for board exams, helping them improve through revision strategies, past paper practice, and personalized feedback.</p>

        <div class="exp12" id="exp12">
            <p>My time at The Citizens Foundation (TCF) College was deeply enriching, as it aligned with my passion for education as a tool for empowerment. Teaching Physics to students from underprivileged backgrounds taught me the importance of empathy and adaptability. I designed simplified lesson plans, used analogies from students' everyday experiences, and incorporated both Urdu and English terms where necessary to bridge understanding. This role sharpened my communication skills, cultural awareness, and inclusive teaching methods, and gave me a deep sense of purpose in education.</p>

        <div class="exp12" id="exp12">
            <p>At The American Foundation School, I taught Cambridge A-Level Physics, delivering high-level content aligned with CAIE standards. This experience honed my skills in curriculum design, differentiated instruction, and concept-based learning. I used simulations, digital animations, and problem-solving workshops to deepen student understanding. I also conducted student progress assessments and parent-teacher meetings, which further enhanced my interpersonal and reporting skills. My expertise in integrating technology into teaching was notably expanded here.</p>

        <div class="exp12" id="exp12">
            <p>While at ICSA Kuwait, I worked as a private and institutional tutor for both O-Level and A-Level Physics students. I developed customized lesson plans tailored to individual learning needs and prepared students for rigorous international examinations. Teaching in an international context helped me become more culturally responsive and flexible in my teaching approach. It also boosted my self-confidence, independence, and ability to assess student performance with a more global mindset.</p>

            <p>At Guards Public College, I served as a full-time Physics lecturer, where I was responsible for delivering curriculum-compliant lectures and preparing students for board examinations. I introduced concept maps, chapter summaries, and interactive questioning sessions to help students retain content more effectively. This environment allowed me to further develop my lesson planning, documentation, and student counseling abilities. It also strengthened my resolve to promote Physics not just as a subject, but as a tool for logical reasoning and practical life skills.</p>
